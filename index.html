<h1 id="ab">About Dark And Lovely</h1>
<div id="about">
<div id="history">
    <p>Dark & Lovely was introduced nearly 50 years ago as the first hair-color product formulated specifically for Black women.</p>
    <p>Over the years, Dark & Lovely has grown to include a complete collection of shampoos, fade-resistant hair colors, relaxers, deep-conditioning treatments, stylers, and hair foods.</p>
    <p>Now, decades later, Fade and Resist, its color collection that is sold in nearly 80,000 retailers, continues to be one of the brand's top sellers.</p>
    <p>The campaign was a new emphasis and an opportunity to speak to a younger consumer who was just being introduced to the legacy brand.</p>
    <p>The campaign featured Gen Z and transgender talent who really laid the groundwork for the brand's now-partnership with actress and activist Storm Reid.</p>
